1 Dependencies
----------------

1.1 Java
----------
XBiG makes use of the new features like generics introduced with JavaVM
1.5. Therefor you will need JRE5 or higher. Get the latest version from
http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/ and follow the installation
instruction for your platform.

1.2 ANT
---------
XBiG uses ANT to build itself and to generate the bindings. Get the
latest ANT version from http://ant.apache.org/ and follow the
installation instructions for your platform.

1.3 Doxygen
-----------
XBiG uses the source code documentation tool Doxygen to analyse the 
source library. Doxygen has already support for several languages and
creates an XML notation of the library interfaces. Get the latest
version from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ and follow the
installation instructions for your platform.

2 Configuration
-----------------

2.1 CPP Compiler
----------------
Open the file /src/ant/config/config_cpp.xml and set the following
properties to match your platform:
    cpp.compiler = msvc|g++
    cpp.platform = win32|linux

2.2 Doxygen
-----------
Open the file /src/ant/config/config_doxygen.xml and set the property
path.doxygen.bin to "installdir/doxygen/bin/doxygen.exe"
	
3 Run a test
------------
If you have installed all necessary dependencies and configured XBiG
then your are ready to run one or all of the tests in the test suite.
Change into the directory /test/t2_1 and run ant with the the parameter
"-lib ../../src/ant/jar/" to point to the libraries needed.

The build of a test includes the following steps:
1. Build of the source library (C++)
2. Generation of the meta layer with doxygen and XSLT
3. Generation of the Java and C++ code for the JNI bindings
4. Build of the JNI bindings.
5. Run of a JUnit test for the generated bindings.

At least you should see the message "BUILD SUCCESSFUL". If the
build was successful you are ready to create a project for the
library you want to generate bindings. Ohterwise something went
wrong and you have to check your environment and configuration.

4 Setup a own project
