Following files contain unicode characters 
in comments which cause problems with the 
java xml parser. They have been removed:
- OgreCompiler2Pass.h
- OgreDynLib.h
- OgreParticleEmitter.h
- OgreParticleSystem.h



In OgreUTFString.h the base class of _base_iterator
has been removed as it caused problems and is not
necessary for our java binding.
